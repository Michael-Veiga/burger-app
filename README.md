## Review

Handlebars proved fairly difficult to use, but I figured it out after reviewing the activities. I did run into an issue with using bootstrap, because it imported the minified version of jquery, which caused an issue with the ajax requests. All in all, I think this homework assignment helped me to better understand file structures and heroku deployment.
